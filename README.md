# Toggl-JIRA-Integration
This script allows you to conveniently track your time in Toggl (https://www.toggl.com) and push your time tracking entries as worklogs to JIRA (https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).
The script has been developed with Python 3 and tested with JIRA 7.2.4.

The configuration options are (mostly) described in the config_example.ini file.
